## Final Reflections

### What is one improvement you can make to your code?

The naming of my variable need some improvement. Sometimes it is hard to think 
of the appropriate names. Also, I noticed that I need to work on code repetition 
because some of my answers are longer than those in the solution. 

### Did you learn something new from the solutions?

I was very overwhelmed with problem 5 in the SQL section and I realized what 
had to be done after submitting it on FRODO. But the solutions helped me determine 
what I was doing right and what I was doing wrong. 

### Anything else?

Javascript really sucks but I am glad I pushed myself to learn it with this 
skills assesment. It took me a long time but I enjoyed the struggle because 
I am so much more knowlegable now.
